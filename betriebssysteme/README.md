# operate windows/linux systems because they run everything. reference for when shit breaks.

## linux
- filesystem structure: `/etc`, `/var`, `/proc` - where configs and logs live
- bash commands: `find`, `grep`, `ssh` - basic operator toolkit  
- permissions: understand `chmod`, `chown`, `sudo` - access control basics
- services: `systemctl` commands - start/stop/debug services

## windows  
- user accounts: admin vs standard vs SYSTEM - privilege levels matter
- powershell: verb-noun cmdlets - better than cmd.exe
- active directory: domain auth, group policies - enterprise pain points
- task manager: process monitoring - when things go sideways

## usage notes
- lowercase commands unless proper names/tools need caps
- code blocks for anything executable
- [!] marks dangerous operations
- TODO marks unknowns that need verification
