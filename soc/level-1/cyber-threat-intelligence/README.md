# identify threats via structured intelligence collection and analysis.

## core intelligence sources
- **commercial feeds**: recorded future, flashpoint, intel471
- **open source**: alienvault OTX, abuse.ch, virustotal
- **government**: FBI, CISA, military threat sharing
- **industry**: financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure  
- **internal**: honeypots, incident analysis, threat hunting

## intelligence types
- **tactical**: IOCs, signatures, immediate defensive actions
- **operational**: campaign analysis, threat actor capabilities  
- **strategic**: threat landscape, long-term trends, attribution

## IOC management platforms
- **MISP**: open source threat intelligence sharing
- **opencti**: structured threat intelligence management
- **threatconnect**: commercial intelligence orchestration
- **anomali**: threat intelligence platform and feeds

## practical applications
- detection rule creation: convert IOCs to SIEM rules
- threat hunting: proactive search for known techniques
- incident attribution: link attacks to known campaigns  
- risk assessment: prioritize defenses based on threat relevance
- intelligence sharing: contribute to community defense

## key threat intelligence URLs
- abuse.ch: malware samples and IOCs
- urlhaus: malicious URL database  
- malpedia: malware encyclopedia and TTPs
- hybrid analysis: automated malware sandbox
- virustotal: file and URL reputation service

[!] validate intelligence quality before operationalizing - false positives erode trust
(._.) intelligence sharing agreements may restrict redistribution and attribution
