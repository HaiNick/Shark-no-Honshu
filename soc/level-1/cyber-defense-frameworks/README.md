# map attack techniques to defensive controls via structured frameworks.

## key frameworks
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs)
- **cyber kill chain**: attack progression stages
- **diamond model**: adversary, infrastructure, capability, victim
- **pyramid of pain**: IOC difficulty and attacker cost
- **unified kill chain**: extended attack lifecycle

## practical applications
- detection gap analysis: identify missing security controls
- threat hunting: structure searches by attack techniques  
- incident response: classify attacks by framework categories
- security controls: map defenses to specific attack methods
- threat intelligence: categorize and correlate threat data

## implementation approach
1. **inventory current controls**: map existing tools to framework
2. **identify gaps**: techniques without adequate detection
3. **prioritize coverage**: focus on high-impact techniques
4. **develop detections**: create rules for priority techniques
5. **validate effectiveness**: test detection accuracy and coverage

[!] frameworks guide strategy but don't replace practical implementation
(._.) attackers adapt faster than frameworks update - supplement with current intelligence
