# KOTH

* Once you've hacked your way to King (root), defend your position by patching services (perhaps start by fixing the method to how you became root).
* Hunt for flags - Often you can win by finding all flags, whilst others are struggling to become King, you could be hunting.
* King.txt file locked? - A user might have used the chattr binary to stop even a root user editing the file.
