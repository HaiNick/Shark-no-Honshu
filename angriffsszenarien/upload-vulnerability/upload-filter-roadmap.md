# upload filter roadmap â€” systematic filter identification

## upload filter test methodology

### 1. extension blacklist vs whitelist

**test:** upload file with invalid extension (e.g., `testingimage.invalidfileextension`)

**result:**
* **failed:** server uses **blacklist** (blocks specific extensions)
* **success:** server uses **whitelist** (only allows specific extensions)

### 2. magic number / file signature filter

**test:** upload innocent file and change magic number (e.g., image to PHP)

**result:**
* **failed:** server filters by **magic number/file signature**

### 3. MIME type filter

**test:** upload file and change MIME type (e.g., to `application/x-php`) using burp suite

**result:**
* **failed:** server filters by **MIME type**

### 4. file length filter

**test:** upload small file, then increasingly larger files until upload fails

**result:**
* discover server's **maximum file size** limit

## notes

* watch for error messages that reveal filter mechanisms
* small file size limits can prevent successful payload uploads (e.g., reverse shells)
* combine multiple bypass techniques based on discovered filters
