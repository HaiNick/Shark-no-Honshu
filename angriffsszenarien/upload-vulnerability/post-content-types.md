# spoofed content-types. lie about your file type to bypass filters.

## common mime types

| extension | content-type | 
|-----------|--------------|
| `.html/.htm` | `text/html` |
| `.css` | `text/css` |
| `.js` | `application/javascript` |
| `.json` | `application/json` |
| `.xml` | `application/xml` |
| `.jpg/.jpeg` | `image/jpeg` |
| `.png` | `image/png` |  
| `.gif` | `image/gif` |
| `.svg` | `image/svg+xml` |
| `.pdf` | `application/pdf` |
| `.txt` | `text/plain` |
| `.zip` | `application/zip` |
| `.mp3` | `audio/mpeg` |
| `.mp4` | `video/mp4` |

## executable mime types to avoid

| extension | real content-type |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `.php` | `application/x-httpd-php` |
| `.py` | `text/x-python` |
| `.sh` | `application/x-sh` |
| `.exe` | `application/vnd.microsoft.portable-executable` |
| `.asp` | `application/x-aspx` |
| `.aspx` | `application/x-aspx` |
| `.jar` | `application/java-archive` |
| `.ps1` | `application/x-powershell` |

## bypass combinations

upload php as image:
```
filename: shell.php
content-type: image/jpeg
```

upload shell as text:
```
filename: shell.php  
content-type: text/plain
```

upload binary as generic:
```
filename: shell.exe
content-type: application/octet-stream
```

## operational notes

- always pair with extension bypass tricks
- use burp/curl to set custom content-type headers
- test server behavior: does it trust the header or check content?
- [!] some servers validate both header and file content

# TODO: test against servers that verify mime vs content
